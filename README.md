## 📋 Overview

This repository contains my work for the British Airways Data Science Job Simulation offered by Forage. The project involves analyzing customer data to uncover insights and predict buying behavior. The goal was to perform tasks that simulate the work of a data scientist at British Airways.

## 📝 Project Tasks

This simulation consisted of two main tasks:

### Task 1: Web Scraping for Customer Reviews
* **Objective:** Scrape and analyze customer review data from a website to identify key themes and sentiments.
* **Process:** [Briefly describe what you did. e.g., "Used Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape reviews, performed data cleaning, and conducted sentiment analysis..."]
* **Key Findings:** [e.g., "Discovered that the most common positive feedback relates to cabin crew, while negative feedback often mentions delays."]

### Task 2: Predicting Customer Booking Behavior
* **Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to book a flight.
* **Process:** [Briefly describe what you did. e.g., "Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessed the data, and trained a Logistic Regression model..."]
* **Results:** [e.g., "The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting customer bookings."]
